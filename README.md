### [unionfs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Starbix/unRAID-plugins/master/plugins/unionfs.plg)
- This project builds a stackable unification file system, which can appear to merge the contents of several directories (branches), while keeping their physical content separate.

### [plexdrive](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Starbix/unRAID-plugins/master/plugins/plexdrive.plg)
- Plexdrive allows you to mount your Google Drive account as fuse filesystem. The project is comparable to projects like [rclone](https://rclone.org/) or [node-gdrive-fuse](https://github.com/thejinx0r/node-gdrive-fuse), but optimized for media streaming e.g. with plex ;)

### [plexdrive4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Starbix/unRAID-plugins/master/plugins/plexdrive4.plg)
- Plexdrive allows you to mount your Google Drive account as fuse filesystem. The project is comparable to projects like [rclone](https://rclone.org/) or [node-gdrive-fuse](https://github.com/thejinx0r/node-gdrive-fuse), but optimized for media streaming e.g. with plex ;)
- Plexdrive v4 now requires MongoDB (you probably need to update some startup scripts)

### [plexdrive-5-pre-release](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syaifulnizamyahya/unRAID-plugins/master/plugins/plexdrive-5-pre-release.plg)
- This contains plexdrive 5 pre release builds. Use at your own risks.
